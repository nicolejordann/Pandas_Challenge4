# Pandas_Challenge4

The script is located under School_data.ipynb 

This is where I obtained the information for counting the number of unique items, rather than just listing them out: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62435475/how-to-count-the-number-of-unique-elements-in-a-column-in-a-pandas-dataframe 

I found this resource helpful when learning how to write conditional filtering formulas

I also experienced a very weird bug that stated 
"C:\Users\Brand\AppData\Local\Temp\ipykernel_4784\1271450144.py:2: FutureWarning: The default of observed=False is deprecated and will be changed to True in a future version of pandas. Pass observed=False to retain current behavior or observed=True to adopt the future default and silence this warning.
  size_math_scores = per_school_summary.groupby(["School Size"])["Average Math Score"].mean()"

  I still have no idea why it happened but this link helped me fix it
